# RSIS
RSIS is a modular, simple simulation toolkit built upon a basis of the Rust language. Blocks, commonly called models in other frameworks, are assembled into simulations, and orchestrated through a higher-level integration with the Julia language.

## Notable Features
- Focus on Code Generation
- Text-Based Configuration Management
- Data Logging straight into Julia
- Monte Carlo support
- Integration with `cargo` for package management
- Supports integration with C++ and Fortran libraries

## Quick Start
To get started, either start with the INSERT HERE TUTORIAL, or go to [Block](./Block.md) in the documentation arena.
